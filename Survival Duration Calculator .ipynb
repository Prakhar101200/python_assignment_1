    "The \"Survival Duration Calculator\" is a Python program designed to calculate a user's age in various time metrics, including months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Alomng with this, this program also includes the function to count user's age with respect to their leap years too. This will ensure user gets an exact ans in every time units. Also, this tool provides a convenient way for users to understand their age in alternative time units, allowing for more relatable and varied perspectives on their lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic Build\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic for the \"Survival Duration Calculator\" is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic operations. Here's how the algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The user is welcomed with a friendly message and prompted to enter their age.\n",
    "The user is presented with a list of time metrics to choose from (months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds).\n",
    "Depending on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding calculation using predefined constants and basic arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions and Operators Used\n",
    "\n",
    "The code utilizes several essential Python functions and operators to execute the calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print: Used to display messages and results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "input: Collects user input for their age and time unit preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements (if, elif, else): Determine which time unit the user wants to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /): Used for age conversion and calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "time.sleep: Pauses the program for 10 seconds if the user doesn't select any option.\n",
    "\n",
    "exit(): Terminates the program if the user doesn't select any option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-Time Use and Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Survival Duration Calculator\" can be valuable for various real-world applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Milestones: Users can gain a new perspective on their age, helping them set and celebrate personal milestones. For instance, understanding your age in minutes can make each moment more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health and Fitness: Individuals tracking their fitness progress may find it motivating to see their age in weeks, making it easier to set short-term fitness goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Management: Professionals can use this tool to comprehend their age in hours, which might lead to better time management and work-life balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Educational Purposes: This code can be used as a learning tool for programming beginners to understand user input, conditional statements, and basic calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Words\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the \"Survival Duration Calculator\" is a versatile and user-friendly application that allows individuals to view their age from different time-related angles, potentially offering a new perspective on their lives. This code serves as a valuable educational resource and can have practical applications in various aspects of life."
