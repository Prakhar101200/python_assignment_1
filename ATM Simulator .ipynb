    "The \"ATM Simulator\" is a Python program that emulates the functionality of an ATM kiosk. This simulator allows users to check their account balance, withdraw money, deposit money, and exit the transaction, providing a virtual banking experience. It ensures that the user input is valid and updates the account balance accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic Build\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for the \"ATM Simulator\" is designed to perform basic banking operations based on user input. Here's how the logic works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The user is welcomed to the ATM kiosk and asked to enter their PIN (Personal Identification Number).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the entered PIN is not a four-digit number, the user is prompted to re-enter it. If they fail to do so, the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the PIN is verified, the user is presented with a menu of options: check balance, withdraw, deposit, or exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user selects \"Check Balance,\" the available balance is displayed.\n",
    "If the user chooses \"Withdraw,\" they are asked to enter the withdrawal amount. If the withdrawal amount is within the account balance, it's deducted, and the updated balance is displayed. Otherwise, the user receives an \"Insufficient balance\" message.\n",
    "If \"Deposit\" is selected, the user is prompted to enter the deposit amount, and it's added to the account balance.\n",
    "If the user decides to \"Exit,\" the program terminates.\n",
    "If the user fails to select any option within 10 seconds, the program automatically exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions and Operators Used\n",
    "\n",
    "The code employs various Python functions and operators to accomplish its tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print: Displays messages, the menu, and account balance to the user.\n",
    "input: Gathers user input for the PIN, withdrawal amount, and deposit amount.\n",
    "Conditional statements (if, elif, else): Determine which action the user wants to perform.\n",
    "Arithmetic operators (+=, -=): Update the account balance based on user actions.\n",
    "time.sleep: Pauses the program for 10 seconds if the user doesn't make a selection.\n",
    "exit(): Terminates the program when the user exits or in the case of inactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-Time Use and Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"ATM Simulator\" serves as an educational tool and can be useful for the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Programming: It provides a practical example of user input, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations for beginners learning Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teaching Financial Concepts: In an educational setting, this simulator can be used to teach students about banking, account management, and financial transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing and Training: Banks and financial institutions can use a simulator like this for training new employees and testing software or hardware related to ATMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Friendly Testing: It allows developers to test ATM-related code without the need for real ATM hardware, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the \"ATM Simulator\" is a valuable tool for educational and testing purposes. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and provides a safe environment for learning and practicing banking-related transactions."
